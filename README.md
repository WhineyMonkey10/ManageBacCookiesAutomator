Quite simple yet useful code to get the _managebacsession cookie of an account with an email and a password. I made this because of a project I'm working on, and the actual authentication cookie for Managebac seems to refresh on every new page load which seems quite overkill, but hey, whatever.
I scoured GitHub and other sources for a simple, yet effective solution for this but I sadly couldn't find any. Some inspired me, but didn't really give me a solution. So that's why I made this :). If this helped you, I'm happy it did! ðŸ˜„
